    "This exercise is structured by the ExploreAI Academy to test learners' knowledge on recommender systems algorithms. In this exercise, we will build a content-based recommendation system using a dataset of Netflix titles. We will preprocess the text data, convert it into numerical features with TF-IDF, and compute item similarities to generate recommendations. This hands-on activity will help us understand and implement key techniques in content-based filtering.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a `content-based recommendation system` using the `Netflix` dataset. The primary goal of this task is to recommend similar titles to users based on the attributes of the media they have already interacted with. This will enhance the user experience by providing personalised content recommendations, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction. By predicting which titles a user might enjoy based on their previous interactions, content-based recommendation systems help platforms like `Netflix` keep users engaged and encourage them to explore a broader range of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is derived from Netflix's collection of movies and TV shows. This dataset includes various attributes for each title, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* show_id: Unique identifier for each title.\n",
    "* type: The type of media (e.g., Movie, TV Show).\n",
    "* title: The name of the media.\n",
    "* director: Directors involved in the media.\n",
    "* cast: Main actors involved in the media.\n",
    "* country: Countries where the media was produced.\n",
    "* date_added: The date when the media was added to Netflix.\n",
    "* release_year: The year the media was released.\n",
    "* rating: The rating given to the media.\n",
    "* duration: Duration of the media (e.g., 90 min, 1 Season).\n",
    "* listed_in: Categories or genres the media belongs to.\n",
    "* description: Brief summary or synopsis of the media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected to provide a comprehensive overview of the available media on `Netflix`. It allows for detailed analysis and exploration of the media's attributes, which is essential for building a recommendation system.\n",
